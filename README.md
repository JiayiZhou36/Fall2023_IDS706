# Fall2023_IDS706
### Purpose
This is for class data engineering mini-project 1. 
This is a Python GitHub template that will be used for the rest of the class (Makefile, GitHub Actions, requirements.txt,
README.md, .devcontainer). 

### Steps
1. I created the template based on the template and video posted by Professor Noah Gift. 
2. In main.py, an add function is created. 
3. In test_main.py, the assert command is used.

### Result
In codespace, code can be run.
Based on action, the template code runs smoothly.
